// 
//   This class holds the pointers to AHG4Element instances, and deliver
//   them for the requests from clients.  As it holds only pointers,
//   you can safely delete any handler instance if unused: but be careful
//   that AHG4MaterialFactory DOES use it if you instantiate a handler
//   and registered it as a part of AHG4MaterialProperty; in such case,
//   you should not delete it, of course.  If you want to do that,
//   you must delete the factory first.
//
//   You can use any number of AHG4ElementHandler at the same time:
//   each of them is independent from others.
//   You can register any elements with any name: if the handler already
//   holds some element with the same name, it will be discarded and
//   the new entry will be registered; at that time, the instance of
//   old entry remains untouched, so no (bad) interference occurs.
//
//   You must NOT delete retrieved or registered element: other part
//   of your program might use it in some part even if you are not aware;
//   AHG4Element itself has a static collection of instances, so some
//   part or library might be trying to access it via other element.
//   Be a paranoia!
